# Login page

This page is designed to allow a user to access the app

## Features

-   Two text fields (one for email and one for password)
-   Input verification based on the criteria provided in the subject
-   An error reporting system using alerts, popups, or toasts

## Input Verification Criteria

-   A password with at least 12 characters
-   An email containing at least one '@'

## Behavior

Since this page is a mock-up, you are not required to implement a real authentication system.

When clicking the "Log in" button, and after the input verification, you should be redirected to the app's main page.

**⚠️ Make sure to save the email locally so that it can be used later.**

## To Go Further

To extend beyond the subject, at the end of the project you can try to integrate a real authentication system by retrieving data from a SQL or NoSQL database such as MySQL or MongoDB.

You can also integrate an authentication system using Firebase, which supports multiple authentication methods (Apple, Google, Facebook, email and password, etc...).
