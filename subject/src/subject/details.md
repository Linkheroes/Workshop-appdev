# Details page

This page is designed to allow a user to view all their todos contained within a todo group.

## Features

-   Four text fields (username, email, password, and repassword)
-   Input validation based on the criteria provided in the subject
-   An error reporting system using alerts, popups, or toasts

## Input Verification Criteria

-   A password with at least 12 characters
-   Both passwords must be identical
-   An email containing at least one '@'

## Behavior

Since this page is a mock-up, you are not required to implement a real account creation system.

When clicking the "Create my account" button, and after input verification, you should be redirected to the app's main page.

**⚠️ Make sure to save the email locally so that it can be used later.**

## To Go Further

To extend beyond the subject, at the end of the project you can try to integrate a real authentication system by saving the data in a SQL or NoSQL database such as MySQL or MongoDB, whether local or remote.

You can also integrate an authentication system using Firebase, which supports multiple authentication methods (Apple, Google, Facebook, email and password, etc...).
