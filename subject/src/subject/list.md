# List page

This page is designed to allow a user to view all their todo groups.

## Features

-   A dropdown list with the category title
-   A search bar for finding a specific category

## Behavior

When clicking on a category, the details page opens.

When performing a search, there is a slight artificial delay to simulate a real search.

## To Go Further

To extend beyond the subject, at the end of the project you can try to integrate a SQL or NoSQL database such as MySQL or MongoDB, whether local or remote, to retrieve todo categories.
