# Workshop - AppDev

During this workshop, you will have the opportunity to choose between two different technologies (Swift and Ionic) for a project.

In this workshop, your goal is to create a mobile application using the technology of your choice.

You can go beyond the proposed topic, and I encourage you to do so to expand your knowledge of mobile development. (Spoiler: this might come in handy for AREA in tek3)

**⚠️ The Swift topic is reserved exclusively for those who have a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or the hub's iMac (only one person allowed).**

## Ionic

Ionic is a mobile framework for developing so-called hybrid mobile applications.

This means that you have a single codebase that defines the behavior for both Android and iOS applications.

Ionic is compatible with several web frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.

But you can also use plain JavaScript without any additional web framework overlay.

In this workshop, you will use Ionic with the Angular framework.

## Swift

Swift is a proprietary language on Apple's operating systems (macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, iOS, or watchOS).

Swift only allows the development of applications for Apple products and currently does not enable development for other types of devices.

In this workshop, you will use SwiftUI, which facilitates the creation of mobile applications, but there is also UIKit, which is also available in Swift or Objective-C.
