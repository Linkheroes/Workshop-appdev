# Ionic

Ionic is a mobile framework that enables the development of so-called hybrid mobile applications.

This means that you have a single codebase that defines the behavior of both Android and iOS applications.

Ionic is compatible with several web frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.

But you can also use plain JavaScript without any additional web framework layer.

In this workshop, you will use Ionic with the Angular framework.
