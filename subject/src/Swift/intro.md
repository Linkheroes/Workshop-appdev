# Swift

Swift is a proprietary language on Apple operating systems (macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, iOS, or WatchOS)

Swift exclusively allows the development of applications for Apple products and currently does not enable development for other types of devices.

In this subject, you will use SwiftUI which facilitates the creation of mobile applications; however, there is also UIKit, which is also written in Swift or Objective-C.
